# Research
My main goals this semester are to design a consistent website which I will use to show case my work. After reading the "Using Portfolio Evaluation for Program Outcome Assessment" article, I gained knowledge on how to evaluate a portfolio through various tools and most importantly identify the tools need and how to obtain the information required. I hope I accomplish my goals this semester.
